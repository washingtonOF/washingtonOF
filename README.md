FullStack Developer in Development
👨‍💻 I'm a Full Stack development student at Digital College in Fortaleza | Ceará | Brazil 🤩 I love technology, music, trips, comedy, my family and friends 🤔 I have a lot of ideas in my mind and I'm interested in collaborating with the developer community <br><br><br><br>


I strongly believe that technology is the future of humanity. Without it we could not evolve to the point we are today, I also believe that we can always evolve a little every day. Find solutions and propose improvements so that organizations' processes are always up-to-date and agile.


<br><br><br><br>

Always learning and evolving
